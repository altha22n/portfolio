	My name is Nada Al-Thawr. I am a Yemeni woman currently living in the US. I am a junior in Mount Holyoke College and I am double majoring in Computer Science and International Relations with a focus on Global Peace and Security. I am a developer that enjoys solving problems- mostly ones that can change lives. Everythign I do, I make sure eventually contributes - in small or in large - to achieving peace in my home country. 

<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of my side technical projects:
	
<br/>
<br/>
- In January 2018, I took a Google Android development course. In that course, I lead a team of 4 in rebuilding a more positive YikYak and called it YikesYak ( for copyright purposes ). We used Android Studio and implemented a Queue Structure and linear layout for the incoming posts. I was in charge of handling the user interaction with our app. I implemented Google login API and register our app through Firebase. 

		<br/>
<br/>
- In September 2017, I lead a team of three in creating a runnable program called blanchOrder using Java. This program is meant to help students order online from our campus center, and saves their requests in a Queue structure. This helps in saving paper, time and provides more accessibility for folks. We are in the process of developing this into an Android App. 

		<br/>
<br/>
- Simmons Hackathon - Dont_Puke: Implemented a web app that pulls health inspection data of restaurants to help in navigating restaurants at Simmons Hackathon within a team of five. We used Ruby on Rails for the back-end and HTML, CSS & JavaScript for the front-end. I was in charge of creating our website and pulling the data and connecting the back-end and front-end.

		<br/>
<br/>
- This year, I am the HackHolyoke chair and director. HackHolyoke is the first Hackathon in the country to have more female identifying participants than male. I managed a team of 13 people as we put the entire hackathon together. Made sure all the hardware and resources were available, managed the entire budget and was an assigned judge during the expo. In judging, I was able to evaluate the different technologies used by the participants. Moreover, I also created a new category called “Hack the World” to encourage participants to widen their horizon to include solutions to problems faced by the world outside of the US borders. 

		<br/>
<br/>
- I also create beginner Computer Science educational material and example programs using Python, Scratch and Arduino C. As a GEM ( Gegas Educate Megas computer science mentor ) I perform software testing on the student’s programs and write code review using upsource. 

		<br/>
<br/>
- I also spent the summer building Websites in my free time using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Built websites for female entrepreneurs in Yemen to encourage their businesses for free.
